# Library Management System (LMS) - CS3700 

## Overview
This project is a Library Management System (LMS) designed as a course project for CS3700. It aims to provide a comprehensive system for managing library operations, including storing, retrieving, editing, and deleting information about various library items such as books, dissertations, conference papers, journal papers, research reports, and magazines.

## Features
- **Class Design:** Modular design with separate classes for each library item, utilizing inheritance and composition to reduce repetition and enhance code maintainability.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly GUI that supports operations like adding, removing, searching, editing, and generating reports for library items.
- **Database Connectivity:** Utilizes MySQL for persistent storage of library data, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Documentation and Testing:** Comprehensive documentation including a UML class diagram and detailed testing scenarios to ensure reliability and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- MySQL Server
- Any Java IDE

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. If using NetBeans, open the project by selecting `File -> Open Project`. For other IDEs, import the project as a Java project.
3. Ensure MySQL Server is running and accessible.
4. Update the database connection information in the project settings to match your MySQL setup. For databse cpnnectivity information, please refer to /*INSERT LINK*/

### Running the Application
1. Build the project using your IDE's build tool.
2. Run the `Main` class to launch the application.
3. Use the GUI to interact with the system.
// If we package this, running the application will not require an IDE at all.... 

## Contributing
Professor Mohammed went over git in class, but as a reminder, to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
